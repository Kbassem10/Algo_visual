Project Objectives
1. Design and implement an intuitive web interface for sorting algorithms visualization
2. Develop step-by-step visual representations of common algorithms
3 Allow users to input custom data sets to observe algorithm behavior
4. Compare performance metrics across different algorithms

 Technologies Used
- Backend: Python with Flask framework
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Algorithms: Python implementation of sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, etc.)

 Features and Functionality
1. Algorithm Visualization Library
   - Step-by-step visualization of sorting algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion, etc.)

2. Interactive User Interface
   - User-friendly controls for starting/pausing/stepping through visualizations
   - Custom data input options
   - Speed/delay controls for the visualization

3. Educational Components
   - Time and space complexity information
   - Comparisons between algorithms

4. User Experience
   - Responsive design for various devices
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Intuitive navigation

 Implementation Plan

   - Set up Flask application structure
   - Implement core algorithm logic
   - Develop basic visualization framework

2. Phase 2: User Interface (1 week)
   - Design and implement the frontend interface
   - Create visualization components
   - Connect frontend to backend API

3. Phase 3: Additional Algorithms (1 week)
   - Add more sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort, etc.)

4. Phase 4: Enhancement and Testing (1 week)
   - Performance optimization
   - Cross-browser testing
   - User acceptance testing
